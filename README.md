Find our the global scale and evolution of AI-assisted mapping in OpenStreetMap

## Introduction

AI-assisted mapping has become an increasingly important tool in humanitarian mapping efforts. With the help of AI, satellite images can be analyzed and interpreted to identify areas affected by natural disasters or conflicts, and to map out the locations of critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools.

In the analysis we focused on buildings and roads that were mapped from AI dataset...

Q1: How many buildings were mapped with AI? Where have the most buildings been mapped?

Q2: How many meters/kilimeters of roads were mapped with AI? Where have the most kilometers of roads been mapped?

## Workflow 
<!--[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)-->
First of all, we downloaded the necessary data for certain regions and relevant time periods in json format via the Ohsome API. We then edited the data to create a DataFrame. We could use the obtained shape of the data to draw graphs. Based on the results from the graphs, we created maps with more detailed results.
